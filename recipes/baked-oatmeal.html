		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>This delicious oatmeal comes together quickly and easily and tastes great. You can definitely make this as described, or you can swap out the pumpkin for another ingredient to change up the flavor! We often swap the pumpkin out for a few cups of frozen berries that we cook on the stove for a few minutes.</p>
		
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>1 15 oz. can pumpkin puree</li>
			<li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
			<li>2 large eggs</li>

			<li>2 1/2 cups old fashioned rolled oats</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Directions</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 375ºF. In a large bowl, whisk together the pumpkin purée, brown sugar, eggs, vanilla, pumpkin pie spice, salt, and baking powder until smooth.</li>
