# odin-recipes
Here is what I think is going to be in here, but I am writing this at the outset, so things could change.

I plan to make a website that includes a few recipes that I love and treasure as a way to show what skills I am learning in the Odin Project. I plan to show off my skills using HTML to set up a basic website. I will also try to practice good practices with git as I make changes.
